# OpenViEWS2

## Getting started

Download and install miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
After you have conda installed, in your terminal run

    ./install_views2.sh

This will create a conda environment called views2 and install the views package there.
To start using ViEWS code simply run

    conda activate views2
    jupyter notebook

A web browser should open with the jupyter notebook browser.

We develop ViEWS on Mac and Linux computers, the procedure is slightly different for Windows and we haven't developed a streamlined process for it yet.

## Prediction competition

If you wish to take part in the prediction competition, start the notebook server as described above and see projects/prediction_competition/example_notebook for an example of how to get started.
